Tweet My Rep is a self-guided project. This app will allow
users to search their United States Congressional and Senate
Representatives by zip code. Once the congress members have been
identified, app users will be able to send tweets to the legislators.

The three most recent New York Times articles about each legislator will
be available on the same page where tweets are composed.
