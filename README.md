Tweet My Rep is a self-guided project. This app will allow
users to search their United States Congressional and Senate
Representatives by zipcode. Once the congress members have been
identified, app users will be able to send tweets to the legislators.

Tweet My Rep will rely on the Twitter gem, the Devise Gem, Twitter's
API and Sunlight Lab's Congress API V3.

As an extension, the app will be able to use IP geocoding to
obtain the location for an IP and then find corresponding legislators.
To accomplish this, I will use the Geo-Kit Rails gem.
